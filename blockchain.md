## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a shared immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking asserts in a business network.
- An asset can be tangible (A house, car, cash,) or in-tangible (property, copyrights, branding)
- A Blockchain is a hash linked Data Structure 
- It is a chain of or records stored in the form of Blocks, which are controlled by 'no-single authority'
- Once an information stored in the blockchain, It is extremely difficult to change or alter it.
- Each transaction in a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves its authenticity.
- Due to use of encryption and digital signatures the data stored on the blockchain is tamperproof and cannot be changes.
- It is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone in the network.

## Importance of Blockchain to Businesses
- Immutability - Data once stored cannot be modified or alter.
- Transparency - It offers transparency so that businesses can track every system detail
- Efficiency - It enables the Business to carry out, Operations efficiently
- Traceability - Offer all time traceability that prevents fraudulent activities
- Security - Utilizes high level cryptography algorithm and methods


## Core that Blockchain will impact
- Supply chain - Improves transparency, Traceability and removes any fraud activities
- Finance - Helps Streamline processes, offers authenticity and economic benefits
- Healthcare - Unique patient data, drug traceability, clinical trials and data security
- Retail - Better inventory management, faster settlements and less paper work


## Key Features of Blockchain
- Immutability - Information within a block can't be altered without producing a change in the subsequent block.
- Distributed Ledgers - It records the transaction such as exchange of assets or data among the participants in the network. It is the type of database that is shared, replicated and synchronized among the participants of a decentralized network.
- Data Security - Blockchain uses cryptography to add a layer of security to the data stored on the network.
It utilizes complex mathematical algorithms that were used to secure the data and systems on the blockchain network. Also, each block on the network carries unique hash which means that no data can be forced or changed by hackers
- Decentralization - The entire blockchain is shared among all the computer of the network, Hence no single authorities controls it.
- Smart Contracts - It helps companies to manage business contracts without the need of third part they are programmed stored blockchain system that run automatically when pre-determined conditions are met. Example a logistics company can haves mart contract that automatically makes payment once Woods have arrived at the port.
- Consensus - A blockchain system establishes rules about participants consent for recording transaction, You can record new transactions only within the majority of the participants in the network, give the consent. A proof of work is requirement that expensive computation can be performed in order to facilitate the transactions. POW exists to enable trustless consensus 
- Mining - it means adding transaction records to the blockchain ledger after confirming the validity of the transaction. It involves using complex hardware to perform mathematical calculations in order to verify transactions.
Computer miner verify the validity of transactions and only then put them into a secure block. 
These blocks combine to form a blockchain. After creating a new hash for every secure block miners are rewarded financially. Mining is needed so that bitcoins are not double spent
- Quick Settlement - traditional banking system is quite slow. Transaction takes days to process after the settlement whereas Blockchain transaction are settled in a short time.
- NONCE - A Nonce in a blockchain is a whole number that is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash.
- NODE - Every participant who runs a computer that contributes to the network also known as node. Node maintains their own copy of blockchain and constantly checks with other nodes to make sure everyone has the same record of data
- Double Spending - Sending a Bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at the same time is called double spending. This must be avoided at all cost.
- Block - Transactions are combined into single Blocks and every 10mins a new block of 1Â MB size of block is created, Every block contains 4 
1. Timestamp(Ref to prev block), 
2. Hash Value(Summary of transaction, 
3. Secure Hashing implies that editing a block without causing a change in the subsequent block is impossible), 
4. Peer to Peer (A highly interconnected network which shows interaction that happened between two peers))

## Working of Blockchain
1. Suppose two users in a blockchain network A and B wants to create a new transaction, A sends 5 BTC to B, They will request the transaction to be mined.
2. The transaction can take place if all other participants in the network verify it as a genuine transaction
3. The data of the transaction requires a hash value to process the transaction each of the participants will check certain information above the transaction such as A has sufficient funds to make the transaction.
4. Once the verification is complete, the transaction is ready to take place Not the transaction is added into memory pool of blockchain.
5. The created block is added to the Existing blockchain. Every new block has a Block header which is consists of Timestamp, hash value, prev harsh and transaction data summary. Every Block has a unique has value which acts like a signature.
6. The Block is mined with the help of Hash function, After this the transaction is completed and money is sent to B.
