## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is a shared immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking asserts in a business network.
- An asset can be tangible (A house,car,cash,) or in-tangible (property,copyrights,brandings)
- A Blockchain is a hash linked Data Structure 
- It is a chain of or records stored in the form of Blocks, which are controlled by 'no-single authority'
- Once a information stored in the blockchain, It is extremely difficult to change or alter it.
- Each transcation in a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves it's authenticity.
- Due to use of encryption and digital signatures the data stored on the blockchain is tamper proof and cannot be changes.
- It is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone in the network.

## Importance of Blockchain to Bussinesses
- Immutability - Data once storerd cannot be modified or alter.
- Transparency - It offers transparency so that businesses can track every system detail
- Efficency - It enables the Business to carry out, Operations efficently
- Tracability - Offer all time tracability that prevents fraudulent activities
- Security - Utilizes high level cryptography algorithm and methods


## Core that Blockchain will impact
- Supply chain - Improves transparency, Tracability and removes any fraud activities
- Finance - Helps Streamline processes, offers authenticity and economic benefits
- Healthcare - Unique patient data, drug tracability, clinical trials and data security
- Retail - Better inventory management, faster settlements and less paper work


## Key Features of Blockchain
- Immuntabiliy - Information within a block can't be altered without producing a change
- Distributed Ledger - It records the transaction such as exchange of a sets or data among the participents in the network. It is the type of database that is shared, replicated and synchronized among the participants of a decentralized network.
- Data Security - blockchain uses cryptographyto add a layer of securityto add a layer of securitychoose the data stored on the networkit utilizes complex mathematical algorithmsandcomplex mathematical algorithmsthat were used to secure the datathat are used to secure the dataand systems on the blockchain networkalso each block on the network carriesalso each block of the network carriesa unique hashwhich means thatno data can be forceddo data can be forced or changed by hackers
- Decentralisation - The entire blockchain is shared among all the computer of the network, Hence no single authorities controls it.
- Smart Contracts - It helps companies to manage business contracts without the need of third part they are programmed stored blockchain system that run automatically when pre determined conditions are met Example a logistics company can havesmart contract thatautomatically makes paymentsonce Woods have arrived at the portonce Woods have arrived at the portnext heavy mining
- Consenses - A blockchain system establishes rules a for recording transcation, You can record new transactions only within the majority of the participants in the network, give the consent. A proof of work is requirement that expensive computation can be performed in order to facilitates the transactions. POW exists to enable trustless consonses 
- Mining - it means adding transaction recordsincrease added transaction recordsto the blockchain leisureafter confirming the validity of the transactionit involves using complex hardwareit involves using complex hardwareto perform mathematical calculationsin order to verify transactionscomputer minus verify the validity of transactionscomputer minus verify the validity of transactionsand only then put themand only then put them into a secure blockthese blocks combine to form a blockchainafter creating a new hash for every secure blockminers are rewarded financiallymining is needed so thatbitcoins are not double spreadnursery
- Quick Settlement - Quick settlementtraditional banking systemis quite slowtransaction takes days to processtransaction takes days to processafter the settlementwhereasdrop chain transaction are settledwhereas blockchain transactions are settled within a short timedata sec
- NONCE  - A Nonce in a blockchain is a whole numbera non speed of blockchain is a whole WHOA is a whole number that isthat is randomly generatedwhen a block is createdwhich then generates a block header hushthen generates a block header hashnexus node head only
- NODE - if we participate who runs a computerthat contributes to the networkthat contributes to the networkalso known as nodealso known as nodemaintains their own copy of blockchainmaintains their own copy of blockchainI am constantly checks with other nodesand constantly checks with other modesto make sureto make sure everyonethe same record of data
- Double SPending - Sending a Bitcoin transaction to two different recipents at the same time is called double spending. This must be avoided at all cost.
- Block - Transcations are combined into single Blocks and every 10mins a new block of 1MB size of block is created, Every block cantains 4 (TImestamp(Ref to prev block), Hash Value(Summary of transaction, Secure Hasing implies that editing a block without causing a change in the subsequent block is impossible), Peer to Peer (A highly interconnected network which shows interaction that happened between two peers))

## Working of Blockchain
1. Suppose two users in a blockchain network A and B wants to create a new transcation, A sends 5 BTC to B, They will request the transaction to be mined.
2. The transcation can take place if all other participants in the network verify it as a genuine transaction
3. The data of the transaction requires a hash value to process the transaction each participants will check certain information above the transaction such as A has sufficent funds to make the transaction.
4. Once the verification is complete, the transaction is ready to take place Not the transaction is added into  memory pool of blockchain.
5. The created block is added to the Existing blockchain.Every new block has a Block header which is consists of Timestamp, hash value,prev harsh and transaction data summary. Every Block has a unique has value which acts like a signature.
6. The Block is mined with the help of Hash function, After this the transaction is completed and money is sent to B.
